# Mission-to-Mars
web scraping, mongodb

## Objective
The goal for this project was to make a program that would automate gathering data from key websites that pertained to Mars.  The Mission to Mars project looked at the following websites:

  - https://spaceimages-mars.com
  - https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
  - https://marshemispheres.com

For this project we used a verity of packages, with a major reliance on MongoDB.  To get to the final product our code also utilized Jupyter Notebook and Python packages:

- Pandas 
- BeautifulSoup
- Splinter
- ChromeDriverManager
- Flask
- PyMongo

Leaning into HTML was also required to synchronize all the work in a easy to consume web page after the web scrape.

## Results

The results are great and the automation is impressive and organized in a central location.
